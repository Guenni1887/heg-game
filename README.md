# The HEGame

Real-life puzzle taking place in the wastelands of the lower saxony low land plains.


## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

### android
```bash
chmod +x ./run-android

./run-android
```

### ios
```bash
chmod +x ./run-ios

./run-ios
```
